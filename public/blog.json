    "body": "The most thing is to choose a suitable programming language first that is appropriate for your learning level and goals. There are many languages for programming. Popular languages for beginners include Python, Java, JavaScript, and PHP. Practice coding regularly. The more you practice, the better you become in programming. Try to write code every day with consistency, even if it's just for a few minutes. The secret is working hard. Your hard work will of course pay a dau to come.",

    "body": "The most important thing is to start with the basics first.You should begin by learning the fundamentals of ReactJS first, such as components, state, props, and JSX most importantly. There are available online courses and tutorials which can be an excellent starting point for your learning. Build small projects, practice building small web applications and apply the concepts you have learned. Start with simple projects and gradually increase the complexity as you gain more experience and become more confident day by day. Understand the component lifecycle,  Learn how ReactJS components work and their lifecycle methods function. This will certainly help you optimize performance and understand how to handle state changes in the course of coding.",

This process will help you stay focused on the end goal and avoid unnecessary features or functionality you feel bothered. More importantly create a road-map of your own. Create a project plan that outlines the different parts of the web app and their dependencies then think on it with attention. This will help you stay organized and will ensure that you are developing the web app in the right order and you will feel confident enough than ever before.",

    "body": "In programming  code is always subject to bugs. So debugging is an essential and unavoidable skill for any programmer especially who is a beginner. There goes some methods for debugging your code efficiently and effectively in a short time. You will need to use a debugger for bug fixing. Debuggers are software tools that help you identify and resolve errors in your code in a vey short time and thus save your time. In debugger you are to set breakpoints, step through code, and inspect variables in real-time. Most modern integrated development environments (code editors) have built-in debuggers that help a programmer debug his or her code. You can comment out your code. Commenting out code can help a programmer isolate the problem by temporarily removing parts of the code. So commenting out code can help a programmer identify where the problem is occurring and what part of the code is causing the error in the file in front. So have patience. No one becomes a good programmer overnight.Have patience and go on coding and the day of your dream will peep you in the days to come.",
